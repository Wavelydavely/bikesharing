Overview of the analysis:

CitiBike in Brooklyn has had its share of success, and we are excited about the possibility of seeding the concept in our hometown of Des Moines Iowa.

Results: 

See our Tableau presentation for an analysis of our data!


Summary: 

We feel CitiBike in Brooklyn provides a model that could be scaled-down to Des Moines. Not only would this concept capitalize on Des Moine's growing touristing industry, but we feel DMBike would in fact boost the appeal of Des Moines.
